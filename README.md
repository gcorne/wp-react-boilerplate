WP React Boilerplate
====================

This WordPress plugin demonstrates how to setup a plugin that uses React and ES6 in a WordPress plugin.


## Getting Started

1. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Navigate to the plugin directory, install `npm` dependencies, and run the dev build command:

```
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-react-boilerplate
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Commands

`npm install` - Install dependencies

`npm run build` – Generate production versions of static assets.

`npm run dev` - Start webpack in "watch" mode so that the assets are automatically compiled when a file changes.
